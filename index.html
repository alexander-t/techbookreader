            <h3>Software books reviews</h3>
            <p>Welcome to techbookreader.com! This site is maintained by an IT professional, who reads a lot of technical
                books in order to stay up-to-date and wants to share some insights and recommendations with other colleagues.
                The topics of the books vary, but they are all related to software development in one way or the other.</p>
            <p>
                The general concept behind this site is simplicity: simple layout, simple reviews and simple recommendations. My
                ambition is not to get overly analytical about every book read. Many deep thoughts and insights dwell in some of
                the reviewed books, but they are left untouched in favor of a simple "read" or "don't read" recommendation.
            </p>
            <p>
                You may wonder why I put up another book review site when there already exist many such sites, and every
                book on Amazon.com is reviewed many, many times. Yes, there are many sites that are dedicated to
                reviewing. However, my ambition is to provide a site where <strong>one</strong> person reads many books and can relate
                them to each other and give a broader picture.
            </p>
            <p>
                When starting out I was hoping that I'd be having a speed/quantity advantage. At that time, I had plenty
                of time, and was hoping that I could read one new book every other week. Nowadays I read and review in
                bursts, but I try to keep a slow but steady progress.
            </p>
            <p>
                This simple introduction should suffice, but if not, please send comments and opinions to reviewer@www.techbookreader.com.
            </p>
            <p>Enjoy!</p>
